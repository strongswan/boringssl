This is a version of the official Android BoringSSL sources slightly modified
to be used as static library within the Android NDK.

It is intended to be used as subdirectory of a project's jni directory, it
just has to be included from the top Android.mk.  Afterwards it can be built
as part of the project directly with $NDK/ndk-build.

To update it to the latest upstream version add the following remote:

  git remote add upstream https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/boringssl

NOTE: This branch might get rebased!
